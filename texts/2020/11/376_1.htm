Seeking out new flavors and creative local cuisine is what we are looking for, during holidays.<br />Our Executive Chef Spyros Voulismas with a wealth of experience and his team have created a menu that’s based on Corfiot, Greek and Mediterranean diet, influenced by “nona’s” * cookery book.<br />Themed dining events with guest chefs and mixologists or fire-pit barbecues by the beach. Impromptu feasts or pop-up kitchens when the fresh catch is right. Whether it’s a causal, pool – side “meze” * or a beach diner under the moonlight, dining at the “Flya” it is a unique experience for your taste.<br /><br />Extensive wine list compiled with one eye on the emerging Greek wine production, plus only the best from the international scene.<br /><br /><em>*nona’s: Grand Mother Corfiot dialect <br />*meze: a selection of hot and cold dishes</em>
