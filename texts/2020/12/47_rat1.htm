The cosmopolitan town of Corfu is the capital of the island, as well as of the whole periphery of the Ionian Islands. Significantly influenced by the Venetians who kept the island under their governance for a long period during the past centuries, Corfu met numerous civilizations over the years and is divided into the Old and the New town. While the New town of Corfu is structured in urban and modern way with large squares and shops, the Old Town, which is a <strong>Unesco world heritage</strong> site, constitutes one of the most picturesque and beautiful places in Greece.
