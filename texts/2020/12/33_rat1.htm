<p style="text-align: justify;">Corfu has a very beautiful and natural environment divided in seashore, lowland and mountain. Because of the heavy rainfalls during winter combined with the relatively mild summer the island has a verdant landscape in which Olive trees are dominant. Its olive groves include 3 to 6 million olive trees, some of which are more than 400 years old!</p>
